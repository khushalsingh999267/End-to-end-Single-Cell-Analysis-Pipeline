# End-to-end-Single-Cell-Analysis-Pipeline
This project focuses on deploying a modular, end-to-end Single-Cell Analysis Pipeline. The architecture leverages the robust structure of community-driven pipelines (e.g., nf-core) for primary data processing, followed by custom modules designed for advanced statistical interpretation

### Project Structure

This project uses a standard directory layout to keep our work organized and reproducible with Nextflow.

-   `config/`: Holds configuration files, such as `nextflow.config`, which defines parameters and execution profiles (e.g., for local, Docker, or AWS execution).
-   `data/`: Stores the raw input data (e.g., FASTQ files). This directory is often excluded from version control.
-   `envs/`: Contains Conda environment files (`.yaml`) that define the specific software needed for each process in the pipeline.
-   `results/`: All output files generated by the pipeline will be saved here by default.
-   `scripts/`: For any custom helper scripts (in Python, R, etc.) that our pipeline processes might call.
-   `workflow/`: This directory can hold modular components of our pipeline, like sub-workflows or custom modules. Our main pipeline script, `main.nf`, will be in the project's root directory.



### Installing nextflow: 
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

This command does two things:
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io: Downloads the installer script.
| bash: Pipes the script directly to the bash interpreter to be executed.
