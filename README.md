# End-to-end-Single-Cell-Analysis-Pipeline
This project focuses on deploying a modular, end-to-end Single-Cell Analysis Pipeline. The architecture leverages the robust structure of community-driven pipelines (e.g., nf-core) for primary data processing, followed by custom modules designed for advanced statistical interpretation
